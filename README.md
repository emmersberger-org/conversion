# Project: Conversion
The conversion project contains example modules that demonstrate how to write different type conversions. The projects 
are used as example code on https://emmersberger.org.

## Module: Currency-Conversion
This module provides an example on how to convert a `Locale` object into a `Currency` object. It wraps the underlying
Java implementation into a Spring converter and provides additional error handling.
